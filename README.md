<h2>Background Info:  </h2>
<p>I was Born in 1990 and lived as an only child, to a Single Mother moving back and forth all over Australia. I’ve now been now residing in Bunbury, Western Australia for the past 6 years with my lovely Girlfriend. Four years ago I finally got the chance to meet my biological Father (Pictured Above), I went from a family of just Two for 27 years, to now having a Half-Brother, 3 Step-sisters, 3 Half-Step-Brothers and more Nieces and Nephews then I can even begin to keep track of. I’m in the process of re-discovering who I am as a person, I’ve changed so much in so many ways over the past 14 years since becoming an Adult, I no longer recognise myself from the teenager I was in High school (All for the greater good of course).</p>
<p>I can’t say I’ve really accomplished anything significant in my life so far, certainly not what I’d set out to do when leaving high school way back then. I’ve watched my life like it’s been a spin off the movie “A series of Unfortunate Events”, except it wasn’t Jim Carrey starring, Its been me. The Technology Industry has been pushing its limits over these past 50 years, but it’s always remained the same to me, I’ve always been able to rely on it. It’s always worked for me, not against me. </p>
<p>To get an understanding of my interest in IT and why I want to broaden my horizons with it, do what I feel I want to do with it and essentially what is feeding my motivation to get up and out of bed every day. You must first understand what Technology has done for me over the years, how the two of us have grown together and how technology is literally saving my life today. </p>
<p>Once you see how far I’ve come, I believe it’ll paint a much clearer picture of why I’m here.</p>
<p>It's been a bit of a journey getting to where I am today, so I’ll summarise to my relationships with technology and how I’ve changed as a person over the years. I’ll keep it as short as possible.</p>
<h3>Why am I here? And where did it all begin? </h3>
<p>I moved around a lot as a kid and even as an Adult, making friends becomes increasingly hard when you’re relocating post codes every two years. The hardest part of a child growing into an Adult is those teenage years in between. Halfway through my last year of primary school, my mother decided the post code we were living in had too much in common with every other postcode we’d lived in so far, They all began with the same number. We packed up our home in Bunbury, Western Australia and moved to Melbourne, Victoria with her new internet boyfriend. I struggled to fit in with the new scenery. The entire demographic of people was different, I was essentially pushed to the side like an outcast at my new school. My first couple years of high school absolutely sucked, I was constantly bullied or being chased around(I was small for my age in my early teens but a late growth spurt helped me reach the 6ft tall marker eventually), I had zero friends, I was quick to start hating school until Fast forward to 2014, shortly after the MMORPG game called “World of Warcraft” was released. I finally found my escape from reality, WoW wasn’t just a game to me. As I was engulfed in the atmosphere of it all, I began to spend all my available time that I could, leveling my way up through Azeroth, I was starting to get to know people, I was making friends (although a lot of them much older than me, I was quite mature for my age at the time).</p>
<p>Every day after school, the entire weekends, I finally had somewhere to be, where I was appreciated and acknowledged for my talent and commitment to the game. Id joined a guild with a small group of people and over the next 4 years I would spend 3-4 nights a week with them, sometimes questing or raiding until the late hours of the night. Technology gave me a way to make some incredible friendships and for the second half of my Highschool, I had some form of friends, some form of a social life. Although told by teachers at school that I had great potential, I gave up on high school and started to spend most days in class with my head on my desk napping (usually due to staying up too late the night before hanging out with 20-40 members of my guild battling through the Molten Core dungeon raid to defeat the Giant Fiery Inferno named Ragnaros)  I only just managed to pass year 11. I was over it and ready to leave.</p>
<p>My third week out of high school, I got a fulltime job as furniture removalist and my WoW time was reduced to the point where I no longer had time for it. Turns out, my personal work ethic was through the roof, I was making so much money, working hard at the age 17 and taking on all the overtime I could get my hands on. I convinced mum it was time to move back to WA, with the perks of working for an International/Interstate Furniture Removalist company, I paid for the move to take us back to WA with my own money and was even offered a position to transfer to once Id gotten back here. </p>
<p>I was now back in Perth as an adult, I’d already saved up and was getting ready to build a house, until I injured my shoulder at work to the point where I couldn’t return to my role as a Furniture Removalist. Building a house was no longer an option and I had to spend the next 8 months rehabilitating my shoulder. This is where I was offered a work experience role at a JB HiFi store. I drifted away from technology briefly and after a couple months of wiping shelves and price tagging products, I was offered a new full time IT salesman position. I excelled with JB Hifi for the next few years, becoming an excellent addition to the IT sales team across 3 stores. I had no official training or qualifications, I just paid attention and learnt all I could. I left JB HiFi at 21 as the one of the youngest Assistant Managers in the country, looking to progress my career and what was intended to go up and onwards only declined with what I can call “A Series of Unfortunate Events”. To sum up the next few years, I’d lost a child to miscarriage, made redundant from a job that I though was going somewhere until they liquidated out of nowhere, had to care for my mother after 3 accidents on her motorbike (one after the other over 2 years, having to move back in with her to care full-time for her until we had a falling out that we never recovered from) and unfortunately 4 separate occasions of homelessness. Had a few years of bad luck that unfortunately would take a turn for the worst.</p>
<p>Fast forward to where my re-introduction to technology is now medically saving my life. In April 2017 I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes, I went so long being undiagnosed that by the time I realised something was wrong and it was time I went and saw a Doctor, it was too late. Excessively high sugar levels for extended periods of time have detrimental effects on the body, Including Peripheral Neuropathy to both feet and legs (severe nerve damage), with a phobia of needles and many other diabetic related complications I was now dealing with another transition to a new lifestyle that by far has been my biggest hurdle yet. Not to mention that Id only just moved in with my new girlfriend at the time, we’d been “Facebook Official” for 3 months when I had to go into ICU at hospital for a week with what’s known as DKA(Diabetic Keto-Acidosis) It’s when the Sugar levels in the blood stream are so high the entire body was starting to shut down. I’d lost a third of my body weight over the 3 months leading up to my diagnosis. </p>
<p>To put into perspective, the normal BSL’s (Blood Sugar Level’s) should be between 4mmol and 8mmol(no higher than 10mmol). Going into ICU the next day and the triage nurse couldn’t determine my BSLs as the meter only goes to 30, I received my first injection of insulin and went to sleep. The next morning while awaiting the nurse to check my BSLs before I could dig into the delightfulness that was my hospital breakfast, the alarms bells were rung, every doctor and nurse within that ward rushed my bedside……My BSL’s were now so low, the meter couldn’t recognise anything lower than 1.7mmol. Nurses had to immediately inject me with what’s called a glucagon needle (essentially, it’s an epi-pen for diabetics, just pure sugar). </p>
<p>I was told I should not have woken up that morning and that if they hadn’t checked my BSL’s when they did, I probably wouldn’t have.</p>
<p>The struggle didn’t just end there, all the new life adjustments with the added complications with my feet and legs. Every day is still a battle while my body is still recovering from all the damage of my diagnosis.</p>
<h4>So, What’s changed? </h4>
<p>What has changed so drastically in the past 10 months to the point where I’m now no longer sleeping 16 to 22 hours per day (yes, per day) and although most of my days are still spent in bed from the pain of my Neuropathy, I’m here committing myself to this course.</p>
<p>I’ve kept myself up to date and have been implementing diabetes related technology to help assist me with my condition for the past 3 years now. I still have my needle phobia to this day, my anxiety over it got so bad in fact that at one stage I could no longer prick my finger to check my BSL’s after having 2 infections in my fingers that became very close to amputation. It was here I stumbled across new technology called Flash Glucose Monitoring from a Abbott’s Medical company called the “Freestyle Libre”, I was able to throw away my finger pricker. This small button like device with NFC capabilities that has a small canula inserted under the skin on the back of your upper arm. I only had to replace every 14 days, All I had to do was open the app on my smartphone and swipe it over the button like I was pay waving the EFTPOS machine at the shops. An instant reading is displayed, not just what my BSL’s are, but how their trending along with the last 8 hours of BSL readings taken at 5-minute intervals, displayed on an easy to read graphic with the added ability of now being able to enter the carbohydrates of my next meal to accurately calculate how much insulin I need to give myself. </p>
<p> In February this year, I was able to make my move to the ultimate game changer when it comes to Diabetes related technology. The Insulin Pump, thanks to the covid-19 pandemic and the sudden boost to pensioner payments, I could now afford to start paying the ridiculously high insurance premiums over the 12-month waiting period to be able to gain access to the pump program. With my pump now taking on the role as my artificial pancreas, I was free from my own human error. My Average BSL’s finally came down. Pre-pump I was still in the high 20mmols. After 6 months of pump therapy, I was finally under 10mmol. This was an achievement that took almost 6 years to accomplish. With a few further advances of this technology and the little button I once had is now Bluetooth enabled and now automatically feeds my BSL’s straight to my smartphone, so long as it remains in range of course. It also feeds this information directly to my pump, with machine learning algorithms that automatically adjusts the constant flow of insulin into my body. </p>
<p>With every year that was passing me by, the complications were getting worse and worse (especially the neuropathy pain in my feet that will still today at times, bring me to tears). I’ll even admit that for quite some time there, I couldn’t visualise myself reaching my 30th birthday. A few months ago, I got to see 32 candles on my birthday cake. </p>
<p>Now I’ve still got a heck of a long way to go in my journey to effectively return as a contributing member of society. My health complications will never fully recover, I won’t ever be allowed to get my driver’s licence due to lack of feeling in the application of pressure between my feet and the pedals. Over this past year leading up to my enrolment into this course, I’ve had to take on so many considerations to my medical condition. My medical bills will skyrocket the moment I lose my low-income pension status and the everyday 9-5 jobs would only leave me struggling further financially, along with the dream of wanting to settle down and have kids with the woman who’s been by side this whole time, sacrificing so much of her own life to care for me on a full time basis. I owe it to her for me just being here today as I’ve lost count the number of times I’ve been physically incapacitated from having a Hypoglycaemic episode to the point of being completely unable to help myself (I’ll discuss Hypoglycaemic episodes in a bit more detail further down).</p>
<p>With so much to take into consideration, I noticed that one particular topic continued to make headlines in all of my online newsfeeds, was the desperately high demand for people qualified in IT. I’ve always been good with troubleshooting everyone’s technological dilemmas that 9 times out of 10, I’d be handed a paperweight and return a working phone to its grateful owner.</p>
<p>So here I am, almost 3 weeks into the course. I still have no idea on what direction of the IT industry I want to go in.  My mind has been consumed with the thoughts of everything I’ve been through and what can I do to prevent anyone else from have to experience what I’ve had to. My minds exploding with concepts and ideas on what I think I could bring to the table with the knowledge I’ve gained so far and what I’m expected to learn in this course. The concept of my first project idea I feel is a big one, I haven’t yet come across anything like it yet and I believe it’ll be a huge benefit to a particular group of Type 1 diabetics out there. </p>
<h5>Ideal Job: </h5>
<p>When I started this section, I had no Idea what I wanted to do. I went to Seek.com.au for some advice about what roles I would qualify for just for the completion of this course. I became overwhelmed at the choices, but a Solution Analyst/Architect appealed to me. Reading the job description about creating full picture solutions for clients spoke to me, I wasn’t sure how or why, so I put a pen in section and decided to reapproach it again later in the assignment.</p>
<p>Once Id gotten through the personal testing section and began to start the Project Idea section, The idea for my ideal job came to me.</p>
<p>I want to work for myself. Run my own business as a Healthcare IT consultant with the aim of helping the type 1 diabetic community better manage their conditions with the help of technology, this can branch to applying the same technology to the help the aged care and disability sectors of the healthcare industry. I understand this Ideal Job can’t be found on Seek or LinkedIn. I feel as though I can apply my own experiences and implement technology in a way that better increases the quality of life of individuals out there by offering a product and service of a Full-picture tech-assisted solutions. I believe my project idea can grow into something bigger to match my Ideal career path.</p>
<h6>Personal Profile: </h6>
 <a href="https://www.16personalities.com">Myer-Briggs Test</a>
 <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/eae095905355f">This is a link to my Myers-Briggs Profile</a>
<p>I’ve never participated in tests like these before, but I took quite an interest in the end results. With Type 1 Diabetes, one of the major health complications associated with the disease is in fact Mental Health. This became a HUGE impact on my condition, even just walking out of the GPs office the day of diagnosis with the last thing he asked me on my way out… </p>
<p>“Are you sure you don’t want me to call you an Ambulance to take you to ICU now?”</p>
<p>At that that exact moment in time, I was squatting in an abandoned homes west unit, with my girlfriend (of which we’d only been dating for 3 months at the time and living together with for 5 weeks) with my 6yr old dog who I’d had since he was 6 weeks old. We had no car, no stable accommodation, I had no family to turn to as I’d just fallen out with my mother, and I don’t yet meet my biological father and his side of my family until about 2.5 years after this day.</p>
<p>The results of this test got me thinking. </p>
<p>I think of the person I was when in high school and how withdrawn from reality in the World of Warcraft to escape the nightmare that was my day-to-day teenage life with no physical social life, only a digital one, compared to the person I was when I was working as an Assistant Manager with 30+ staff to delegate, here I no longer had a digital life but an insanely huge social butterfly lifestyle of going out with friends every night, then I think of the person I was walking out of that GP surgery and to the person I am today writing you this report. Each person is ENTIRELY different to the next, I could go through and explain but that’s too much in depth of a personal topic for this assignment. </p>
<p>I just wanted to make a note to my appreciation of what this test represents, completing it as honestly as possible, reading through it and there’s not a lot I can argue about the results. Of course, not everything was on point, but they definitely were pretty damn close about the person I am today.</p>
<p>My Personality score was an Assertive Adventurer (ISFP-A):</p>
<p>The opening paragraph to being an adventurer:</p>
<p>“The Beauty of an Open Mind</p>
<p>Adventurers embrace a flexible, adaptable approach to life. Some personality types thrive on strict schedules and routines – but not Adventurers. Adventurers take each day as it comes, doing what feels right to them in the moment. And they make sure to leave plenty of room in their lives for the unexpected – with the result that many of their most cherished memories are of spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment outings and adventures, whether by themselves or with their loved ones.”</p>
<p>After reading this opening statement, I couldn’t believe how close to the truth it was, dealing with the management of my condition has been the most hardest thing I’ve ever had to endure. I can tell you about how I used to do a 60km bike ride as fun exercise before my shifts at JB HiFi on Thursdays for late night trading shift when I didn’t have to start until midday. Now I struggle just getting out of bed to walk to the toilet.</p>
<p>This opening statement has been the attitude I’ve learnt to adapt over time to improve my overall quality of day-to-day life. I adapt and have made myself flexible to every situation that hits me, the only schedules and routines I’ve had to stick to have been my own (unless it’s a doctor’s appointment I’ve had to wait for some time of course). With the love and dedication of my Partner, who has stuck by me through everything we’ve had to endure, we are anything but the strongest of relationships. </p>
<p>It’s my ability in being so flexible and adaptable that I’m able to incorporate this bachelor’s degree into what I call “My Overall Health Rehabilitation Plan”.</p>
<p>I’m still working on my game plan on how I’m going to be an effective team member, but like the quote says, I take each day as it comes. I’ll still write up my own day-to-day routines like I usually do, but I’m going to be leaving plenty of room to include those group-related tasks.</p>
<p>I felt I had to mention how I felt about the significance of the test in relation to the differences I’ve noticed in how I’ve changed and adapted myself over the years. Some happening naturally on their own out of the directional path my life made through those choices(like a version of my own multi-verse timeline from the butterfly effect of my day-to-day decisions made in life) and some like the result of being an Assertive Adventurer, that I believe I have  developed sub-consciously over these past couple years as a way to deal with the never-ending changes in my life, all the while being able to cherish each and every day I’m able to spend with my partner. </p>
<p>This heavily ties together with my Introduction of my interest in IT, the motivation/dedication/inspiration that’s driving me to complete this course to return to an everyday regular lifestyle, try to do the whole settling down thing with the future-to-be-Mrs-wife and  future-to-be-unborn-kids with the white picket fence but at the same time be able to provide for the future of my yet-to-be-determined-family-dream.</p>
<h7>Online Learning Style Test:</h7>
<a href=https://learningstylequiz.com/quiz/start.php> Personal Learning Styles</a>
<p>I went into this test with no practice runs to get the most honest answer of where I’m at in relation to my successful return to society. I found the results to be quite interesting and true. I’ve always been able to accept feedback, doesn’t matter how harsh or negative the feedback may be, if I feel its honest and I can agree with the criticism given to me, then I’ll take it on board. It’s the only way to learn from my mistakes. So far, I’ve been able to agree with a good 95% of the results coming from these tests, making this activity quite a valuable resource for me to utilize.</p>

<p>I couldn’t believe what I was reading about ISTPs, this was me all over, it made me think more and more about the ideal job section as I still was undecided of my direction.</p>
<p>“ISTPs want to know how everything works. This often drives their desire to learn a new language, as it helps them to better understand a culture and how it functions. When they grasp how they can use a set of material being learned, their interest level spikes dramatically. The ISTP wants to be able to work within every system and with every tool they encounter. They are active learners and doers, and aren’t one to sit around and watch others have all the fun.</p>
<p>The ISTP firmly holds on to practical information and concrete solutions and endings. They learn material easily through real-life examples and situations that allow them to try it out for themselves. They work well independently, often building a thought process that works through material or a problem quite efficiently. ISTP learners can recite steps, information, and material for future use even in quickly changing scenarios.</p>
<p>ISTPs take what they learn and actively apply it to real-life situations. They work closely and engage with material, wanting to fully understand how it operates. Immersive language learning environments are typically quite productive for them, allowing the ISTP to process, memorize, and recite what they are learning.”</p>
<p>After reading the opening paragraph quoted above and how close the professionals were able to analyse me as a person, gives me the perfect basis to utilizing their Optimal learning suggestions, whilst also showing me exactly my weaknesses and ultimately what I need to be practicing more on.</p>
<p>OPTIMAL LEARNING SITUATIONS:
•	Practical material presented in actionable situations.
•	Material is presented repeatedly and with examples.
•	The learning process is progressive but not rushed.
•	Study and presentation materials are reviewable.</p>
<p>WHERE THE ISTP STRUGGLES:
•	Hypothetical or theoretical examples are provided for the material.
•	They can’t see where they will use the information.
•	Heavy focus on problems with little emphasis on solving them.</p>
<p>Going further and further through this assessment is in itself becoming the most insightful overall perspective of where I want to be going in my IT career.</p>
<h8>Further Online Test:</h8>
<p>When I reached the Ideal job section of this assessment, I got overwhelmed with just the options that branched from the completion of this course, let alone what I could accomplish with further study. I spent hours and hours browsing job descriptions, trying to get even the slightest of ideas. So, to better manage my time, I told myself, I’d come back to it. </p>
<p>I got to this section and went to Google for some assistance (Google voice assist just in itself helps me every day, even just the ability to voice communicate the Waze navigation app on my partners phone, as she hates the function, but she’s horrible with directions and I got tired of us arguing over a simple 5 minute car trip, so for me in the passenger seat, it’s a god-send to be able to shout out.... “Hey google, take us home please” and instantly she’s got step by step instructions on her dash to get us home, since then, we have not had a single even slightly elevated discussion on the topic of how to get anywhere on any day).</p>
<a href=https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/types-of-pre-employment-testing> 7 Types of Pre-Employment Assessment Tests Indeed.com</a>
<p>This link spoke to me the most, as I’m in the progress of returning to the workforce, I needed something that’s going to fit my current perspective. I figured I’d pick a test best tailored to my situation and from there I came to the conclusion, that I would take a Cognitive Ability test, Specifically the General Aptitude Test (GAT). This will highlight my ability to approach a different range of logical, verbal, and numeric reasoning of tasks. This test will question me about my mental capacity and hopefully help predict my future job performance and how I handle complex situations. The Indeed website advises to take practice tests to prepare myself for the answers of the test. But that’ll defeat the purpose of what I was now determined to start getting some honest professional opinions. So as a disclaimer, I state that in all my testing done in this assessment. I have not “practiced”, nor have I completed these tests in my life prior to this day. I wanted a professional and realistic expectation of my future. I know I can work hard as Its only week 3 and I can’t believe I’m still here to be honest but I’m taking each day as it comes and so far, each day as it comes is working for me.</p>
<h9>My General Aptitude Test Results:</h9>
<a href=https://www.aptitude-test.com/general-aptitudetest.html> General Aptitude Test</a>
<p>I went into this test full well knowing I would not be receiving a very high score; I feel it’s not all too bad considering my circumstances. It’s also suggested what areas I need to be paying most attention to for improvement. I intend to come back to this test in maybe a year or 2 time and re-do it to re-assess myself and check my progress.</p>
<p>“1) Verbal Reasoning Score: 60%</p>
<p>2) Spatial Reasoning Score: 50%</p>
<p>3) Abstract Reasoning Score: 39%</p>
<p>4) Quantitative Reasoning Score: 60%</p>
<p>Overall score: 52% </p>
<p>Correct Answers: 42/81</p>
<p>Wrong Answers: 39/81</p>
<p>Unanswered: 0/81</p>
<p>Total time: 65min. 46 sec.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Your score in the verbal reasoning sub-test was average, you should focus on your verbal reasoning practice. Consider practicing our word analogy and word relationships questions.</p>
<p>Your score in abstract reasoning was not good, you should definitely focus on your abstract reasoning practice. Strongly consider practicing our abstract reasoning and inductive reasoning questions.</p>
<p>Your score in quantitative reasoning was average, consider focusing to improve your quantitative reasoning ability. Practice our numerical logic questions to get better.</p>
<p>Your score in the spatial reasoning sub-test was below average, you should focus on your spatial reasoning practice. Consider practicing our spatial ability questions found in the non-verbal category.”</p>
<p>One thing I must acknowledge a fact about myself is that I’ve noticed how far I’ve withdrawn myself from public society. From being a huge social butterfly and having every weekend packed filled with nightlife and social-event type situations, to not wanting to go out to the shops for the pure fact of the potential interactions I may or may not have to encounter leading to the ultimate decision of whether or not I actually now want to go to shops or can I stay at home and settle with my current options or if desperate enough do I get something delivered instead. That’s just anxiety in me that’s developed from my condition.</p>
<p>I wanted to test myself to analyse and acknowledge if I actually have the ability to return to the workforce and what I have to work on that I can incorporate into my hopeful successful completion of this course. Prior to taking this test I do acknowledge that my sociability skills have definitely taken a huge reduction in these past few years. However, my current most important team, the relationship with my partner, is the strongest team I’ve ever worked with. Although I’m seeing some low scores from these tests, Its going to show me what I need to improve on over the next 3 years of this course.</p>
<p>It was at this stage of the first draft of this assignment my ideal job formed and from that the main concept of my project idea took a huge turn. As I type this first draft, my brain explodes with possibilities, designs, concepts, blueprints everything. So, I’ll just jump straight into it.</p>
<h10>My Project Idea:</h10>
<p>My idea is one that I feel has a huge potential for the healthcare and technology industry and it’s something I feel could pave the way to help and assist those with similar health conditions take away the stress and excessive burden of managing these conditions to try and use technology to automate and increase self-awareness of emergency situations.</p>
<p>One of the biggest, scariest things I’ve had to deal with so far being a Type 1 Diabetic is having a hypoglycaemic episode (put simply, Low blood sugar levels.) If you’ve ever watched the movie “Paul Blart: Mall Cop” with Kevin Hart, there’s a scene where Paul Blart is running along and his sugar levels drop, he hits the floor and must literally eat a dirty lollipop off the ground. As funny as it is to watch this scene, physically experiencing one of these events is something I don’t even wish on my worst enemy. If you’re aware of your BSL’s (blood sugar levels) at all times, like with the use of a CGM device (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) then you’ll receive alarms and alerts from your smartphone, insulin pump or whatever device used to receive the constant data feed of BSLs. But what about those who still have to prick their fingers, pricking your finger over and over and over again becomes painful, limiting you to maximum 6 times per day to know where your levels are at. </p>
<p>Some Diabetics will also develop what is called hypoglycaemic unawareness, where the onset effects of “having a low” are delayed significantly. </p>
<p>When I explain to people what “having a low” is like, I think of it like an emergency countdown timer, I don’t know exactly how long I’ve got, I just know that I feel weird, and I’ve got less then minutes to fix the situation or I’m in serious problems. The worst thing about it, is that my entire life force is just sucked out of my body, I feel weaker and weaker the longer time passes, the weaker I get the more confused I become, I’ve now lost my sense of time as if everything goes slow-mo and I can no longer rely on myself to do something as simple as get to my nearest source of sugar, it’s at point I know I’m in trouble and all I can do is yell out my name partners name then yell “SUGAR!!!”</p>
<p>If not for my partners quick responses to get to my aid, I would literally not be here today.  I cannot count how many times this scenario has already played out over these past years. Even now as I check the data stored on my smartphone from my CGM over the past the 60 days, I can tell you I experienced 5 situations of “having a low”, 1 of which I got as low as 2.2, this particular moment I was completely unaware of it, I didn’t have my phone on me, so I wasn’t in range of it for it to the be able to alert me with its incredibly loud notification tone that I was now in the danger zone. </p>
<p>Its experiencing this constant brush with life or death that gave me the idea for my project.</p>
<p>Even with CGM alerts there are still situations I find myself in, where for some reason or another, I don’t get an alert.</p>
<p>I want to apply Smart home devices, to help assist with certain emergency warnings and alerts. For example, If I were to be having a low while sleeping, but I’m so tired I don’t wake up to the sound of the alerts from my device. Many times, I’ve reviewed my CGM data from the night before, watched the graph dip down into the low but not waking from the alerts. </p>
<p>What if another option could be to utilize the smart home switches, they install behind the switch of a light that connect to a home’s pre-existing Wifi network that will essentially flick the light switch on and off, repeatedly in a specific sequence, in order to wake you up. Of course, certain precautions would need to be applied for potential epileptic seizure concerns. </p>
<p>Like when my insulin pump vibrates in a morse code like sequence where I can tell which sequence refers to what type of warning. (Eg the vibration sequence between actually “having a low” compared to “BSLs falling at a fast rate of X mmol per X amount of time” are completely different). I want to apply the same concept but in a more visual aspect. Thinking of someone who may be Deaf and Diabetic, or a parent with a Diabetic child, a technological solution like this would make a huge world of difference to the impact the stress of managing this condition would have. This concept has so much potential for growth. Vibrational devices could be installed onto a bed frame or into the mattress itself, something that’s going to do more than just try to use sound to wake you up.</p>
<p>When I break down the statistics of diabetes in Australia from Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.</p>
<a href=https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/diabetes/diabetes/contents/how-many-australians-have-diabetes> Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Statistics of Diabetes in Australia</a>
<p>In Australia, In the year 2001, It was estimated that approximately 623,000(3.3%) Australians were living with either Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes. In just 8 years, in 2018 this figure almost doubles to an Its estimated 1.2 million Australians, that’s 4.4% of our population. Their data also shows that out every 4 adults who have been diagnosed, there’s 1 who’s undiagnosed. This category of undiagnosed individuals is one that I fall under and unfortunately the body will only run for so long without insulin before the health complications arise.</p>
<p>With such a growing number of people each year being diagnosed, gives me perfect opportunity to grow and expand from my original project idea.</p>
<h11>The Idea:</h11>
<p>Adding smart home devices to help better manage a particular health condition and how to better alert the user of an impending emergency situations. My first idea of the concept is to add a smart home light switch to flicker in a sequence to wake me up from an unaware low. </p>
<a href=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypoglycemia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20373689> Mayoclinic Guide to Treating Hypoglycaemic Episodes<a/>
<p>From the Mayoclinic’s website, the standard Treatment for a Hypoglycaemic episode are as follows:</p>
<P>Step 1 - Eat or Drink 15grams of fact-acting Carbohydrates, then recheck BSLs in 15min</p>
<P>Step 2 – If BSLs have not started to rise back to 3.9 mmol or more, then repeat step 1</p>
<P>Step 3 – Once BSL’s are back in range, eat a Low GI snack.</p>
<p>Not only will the alert flash a sequence of flickers but I’d like it to repeat the sequence every 15 min until it either recognises my levels returning to normal range or that I activate a button on a smart home switch to tell the program that I’ve treated the alert and return to sleep without a further interruption. I’d have to put certain loops in place to then flash the sequence again in an hours’ time if in case the original course of treatment was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>This Idea can be implemented in a few ways, depending on the clients available budget. There are smart home Switches that can be wired in behind the wall by a licenced electrician for a more permanent solution. In my situation though, I’d rather opt for the budget friendly version, where the use of a smart home plug will act as my switch to a standard 240v lamp that sits on my bedside table.</p>
<p>This brings an element of scalability to future “Full Packaged Solutions”</p>
<p>To be able to accomplish my project idea in the budget friendly option I will require the following tools:</p>
<p>A Smart Home plug: The Grid Connect Smart home plug sold at Bunnings hardware for approx. $20</p>
<a href=https://www.bunnings.com.au/arlec-white-grid-connect-smart-plug-in-socket-with-energy-meter_p0273367> Smart home Plug<a/>
<p>These plugs come with their own “Grid Connect” Application to help with initial setup. It does also require a home Wifi network to connect to and a compatible smart phone to set up.</p>
<p>The only other item I’d need to complete the project would be a lamp (thanks to the use of a smart home plug, this device doesn’t have to be a lamp though, it could be a floodlight with high intense LED spotlights, it could be linked to a vibrating device under the pillow or attached to the bed). </p>
<p>My project to start with will utilize the Application provided from Grid connect to get everything connected and working. The future concepts this project idea opens up to me possibly creating my own application to integrate my own third-party devices to get closer to that “Full-picture solution”, This could include the use of raspberry pi and Arduino boards to create a Bluetooth network that could utilize network mesh type technology to give full coverage across the entire house. By adding this network to my home, my CGM device would be permanently linked to an alert system, not just my smartphone. It would expand on my current idea of activating a light switch to alert me to wake up to possibilities of being able to read BSLs on every smart home device around the house (Eg Google smart screens, alexa echo type devices, there could be multiple rooms with sensors that’ll detect which room you’re in as to which lights should be flickering through motion sensors). The application of this idea alone goes into so much depth that I’ll have to “put a pen in it” for future implementation. </p>
<p>The skills required for the basis of my Idea I believe I already acquire, hooking up a smart home plug to run a lamp with “If This That Then That” (IFTTT style protocols) to activate on particular scenarios. The only skill I will require is how to get the smart plug to receive data from my CGM device to be able to follow through with my IFTTT commands.</p>
<p>The CGM device I use is called Dexcom G6. Over the years the parents of children with Type 1 Diabetes have turned to the open-source community and together they have developed, maintained, and support a project called “Nightscout”</p>
<a href=http://www.nightscout.info/>Nightscout website<a/>
<p>This project allows the users CGM data to become cloud-based data and be utilized for purposes that aren’t officially/readily available. It allows for real-time access to CGM data via a personal website, smartwatch faces, app and widgets for smartphones.</p>
<p>They even have a Github link for a complete guide on how to get started:</p>
<a href=https://nightscout.github.io/>Nightscout Github<a/>
<p>It’s the implementation of this open-source cloud-based application that will allow me to bridge the connection between my own CGM device and the lamp itself.</p>
<p>To further future-proof my Ideal job though, It would require me to be able to build my own application to tie together the home network of not only smart devices, but I believe the introduction of raspberry pi/Arduino products will allow me to venture away from the pre-manufactured products, to design and build my own complete more budget friendly solution.</p>
<p>There is no final outcome yet define in my plans for this project, I’ve included a few examples along the way throughout my project idea to show its potential to be expanded upon. I believe that the potential prospects that stem from this idea alone are far too great to even attempt to start listing here. </p>
<p>I’ve got a huge focus directed at assisting others that share my condition in the attempt to help us better manage our condition, this too could be expanded to so many other aspects of the healthcare and technology industry. Voice activated solutions for those with physical implications (Eg “hey Google, open/close the bedroom door” would automatically close your bedroom door, a perfect addition to someone in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>It might not sound like the most complex of project ideas, but it’s something I strongly feel is in very high demand and it’s something that I’m insanely passionate about. </p>
